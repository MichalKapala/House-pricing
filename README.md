# House pricing
 This repository contains jupyter notebook for Kaggle house pricing compettition.
 
 Notebook, which is the most important file in this repositroy, is divided for several main parts:
 
 1. Understanding problem.
	In this part i have analyzed the problem from human side. It's important to realize what matters in house prices.
2. Data mining.	
	Here i explore given data for better understanding. At first is visualized target distribution, then i look for correlated features.
3. Data cleaning.
	Basic operations on data: dealing with missing data, removing outliers, working with skewed data, removing too correlated data and encoding categorical features.
4. REGRESSION:
	Here we are. Now I can can pick, train and test estimators. By  cross-validation i test Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. Finnaly I pick Linear Regression and I make prediction price for test data.

SCORE: My predicitions was evaluated on Kaggle by RMSE on 0.13431 what place me on 2222/4554.

CONCLUSIONS: This is not perfect score. It give me for thought I can improve my prediction and I'm sure i will back here in nearly future.
